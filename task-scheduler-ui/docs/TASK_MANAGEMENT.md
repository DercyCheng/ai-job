## Usage Examples

### Task Batch Operations
The task batch operations can be triggered from the dropdown menu in the Tasks page:

1. **Batch Cancel**: Select pending tasks and use the "Batch Cancel" option to cancel multiple tasks at once
2. **Batch Retry**: Select failed tasks and use the "Batch Retry" option to retry them
3. **Batch Delete**: Select any tasks and use the "Batch Delete" option to remove them
4. **Export Tasks**: Select tasks and use the "Export Tasks" option to download them as JSON
5. **Import Tasks**: Use the "Import Tasks" option and paste JSON data or upload a file

### Notifications
The new GlobalNotification system can be used throughout the application:

```typescript
import GlobalNotification from '../components/GlobalNotification';

// Success notification
GlobalNotification.success('Operation completed successfully');

// Info notification
GlobalNotification.info('Process is running');

// Warning notification
GlobalNotification.warning('Low disk space');

// Error notification with message
GlobalNotification.error('Failed to save', 'Check your network connection');

// Error notification with Error object
try {
  // Some code that might throw
} catch (error) {
  GlobalNotification.error('Operation failed', error as Error);
}
```

## Testing Notes

1. Test all batch operations to ensure they work correctly
2. Verify that the notification system displays appropriate messages
3. Check that the enhanced logs component correctly filters and displays log entries
4. Confirm that task priority is displayed with the correct color coding
